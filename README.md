# Movie Recommendation System - Machine Learning App
This project uses the LightFM dependency to make a prediction of the top 3 movies to recommend to users based on their ratings for other movies.

The output, as always, is in the PNG file, and is rather promising. Although the number of epochs were relatively small (n = 30), the system predicted one movie perfectly, and other movies were also rather similar to the ones rated highly!
